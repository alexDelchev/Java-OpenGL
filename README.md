The engine supports .obj, .dae, and .md5 format 3D models. Features include:
- Skeletal animation
- Shadows
- Fog
- Mouse picking
- Sunlight
- Other sources of light such as lamps
- Terrain collision
- Basic interface which allows the user to place buildings on the terrain

The Collada(.dae) importer can easily be altered to return raw data such as
vertex positions, texture, and indices arrays as well animation data.
